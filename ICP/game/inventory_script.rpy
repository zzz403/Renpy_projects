script.rpy File ------------------------------------------------

This file contains the following:
1. All the variables for the inventory system which should be added to the start label in your script.rpy file.
2. All the code for setting up the scene and environment items
3. Transform code

All of the lines of code are commented to explain the purpose and functionality.

For explanations on how to modify/configure this file for your own level, please reference the inventory guide!

For more detailed explanations about the code, feel free to check out this tutorial series:
